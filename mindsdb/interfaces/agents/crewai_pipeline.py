            "knowledge_base_name" is the name of the knowledge base, and "relevance_threshold" is the 
            relevance threshold for the semantic search and it should be between 0 and 1. and always should you "=" operator for it not 
            "<=" or ">=" or ">" or "<". You can choose default value for relevance_threshold of 0.6 if not provided in the user query.
            Also ensure you use single quotes (') not double quotes (") for string literals in SQL.
            
            Validate your SQL with the check_sql tool before finalizing.

            Note: 
            - If the previous output indicates a general conversation or greeting, acknowledge that no SQL query is needed.

            Execute the EXACT SQL query using the execute_sql tool WITHOUT modifying it.
            
            IMPORTANT: 
            - Never modify, truncate, or change the SQL query in any way
            - Execute the exact query as provided, even if it contains very long string literals
            - Preserve the complete structure and values of the original query
            - If no SQL query is provided (due to the nature of the user input), acknowledge that execution is skipped.
            
            The output MUST be a JSON/dictionary object containing the raw query results.
            Example output format:
            {
                "columns": ["col1", "col2"],
                "rows": [

            - If there was an error, replicate the error information in the 'text' field and keep 'data' empty or as provided.

            - If the original query was a general greeting or conversational input, respond directly to 
            the user to answer the general question based on your general knowledge. This is the user's original 
            question or query: "{user_query}"
            - If SQL execution was performed, format and present the results accordingly.

            - If user asked a question that still needs to extract information or interpretation from the result, 
            then extract and pass it into the 'text' field and still keep 'data' field as it is.
            
            - Based on your evaluation if the result is not enough to answer the user's question, 
            then you can pass your insight as string to Query Understanding Agent to start over a more complimentary solution.
