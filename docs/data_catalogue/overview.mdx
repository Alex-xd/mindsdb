# Data Catalogue

The **Data Catalogue** in MindsDB plays a key role in enhancing the context available to agents when querying data sources. 
By automatically indexing and storing metadata—such as table names, column types, constraints, and statistics—the catalogue 
empowers agents to understand the structure and semantics of the data, leading to more accurate and efficient query generation.

### Why It Matters

When agents interpret natural language questions or generate SQL queries, access to metadata improves their ability to:
- Understand relationships between tables and fields
- Infer joins, filters, and aggregations more intelligently
- Avoid syntax errors due to missing or unknown schema information

This metadata layer ensures that agents are not querying in the dark.

### Supported Integrations

As of now, the Data Catalogue is available for the following integrations:
- **Snowflake**
- **Salesforce**
- **BigQuery**

### Enabling the Data Catalogue

To enable the Data Catalogue feature in MindsDB, update your `config.json` file by setting the `data_catalog` flag to `true`:

```json
{
    "data_catalog": {
        "enabled": true
    }
}
```

### How It Works

When you create an agent in MindsDB that connects to one of the supported integrations, the Data Catalogue automatically:
1. Inspects the data source
2. Extracts metadata for all accessible tables and columns
3. Stores this information in a dedicated catalogue schema (`DATA_CATALOG`)
4. Makes this metadata available to agents and users via both SQL queries and internal reasoning

### Limitations (Current)

> ⚠️ This feature is still evolving and has some known limitations:

- **One-Time Snapshot**: Metadata is generated only once—at the time the agent is created. If the data schema changes (e.g., new columns, renamed tables), the Data Catalogue will not automatically update. A refresh mechanism is planned in a future release.
- **No Manual Feedback**: If any metadata appears to be incorrect (e.g., wrong row counts or data types), there is currently no way for users to flag or correct it. A feedback system will be introduced soon.
